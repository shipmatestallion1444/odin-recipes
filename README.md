An html-only website with some fake recipes

We try to create a website that is filled with recipes. 
On the way, we'll refine our knowledge of lists, links, formatting and html in general.

Q: What have I learned?

A: - So far, I've learned:

    1) To add CSS;
    2) To improve my HTML with <span> and <blocks>; what is an inline, what is a block?
    Ive really improved my site i thinK!
    I'm especially proud of my navbar, which features a dropdown menu!
