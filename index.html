<h1 id="pageNameHeader">Recipes from Robot Hell</h1>

<p>Welcome to my recipe page! Here you can see all my lovely recipes.</p>

<p class="devNote">This is a website that was made as an exercise in HTML and CSS - almost all of the text is (curated) outputs of a text AI. You should not believe anything you read on here - and you should not be fooled into thinking that any of this makes any sense.</p>
</section>
<article class="blogPostAI">I also have videos on how to do some of them. If you find a recipe you like, please let me know by leaving a comment. I love reading about how people made the recipe and what they think about it. I do not add any of my own photos to my recipes, they just look better when you have someone who knows how to take photos do it.
    <br> I am always trying to improve my recipes and make them more successful. If you would like to suggest a recipe, send me an email at: <em><strong>REDACTED (ed.)</strong></em> and I will put it on my list of recipes. I do not accept sponsored or review recipes, but if you would like to do that, or have a recipe you would like to share, please do let me know.</article>
