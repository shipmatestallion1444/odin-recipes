    <h3>SEEEEEYMOOUUURRR!!!</h3>

    <p>Superintendent, I hope you're ready for some mouthwatering hamburgers. You thought we were having "steamed clams"? No, I said "steamed hams!". That's what we call hamburgers. Gee. Really? With my new teeth and dentures, I won't even chew? A lot of today's kids, their teeth and teeth-holes, I don't know, it's called cavities, they are about gone.</p>
    
    <h3>The Kitchen (aka Krustyburger)</h3>
    
    <p>To create some mouth-watering steam hams, many chefs add the barbecued pig’s head to the mix. The pig head adds rich fat and tangy flavour. “It’s a thing of beauty to cook the head. Make sure the pork fat stays on the skin and the pork is thoroughly cooked. A good chef will have it cut into slices and serve it on the side for everyone to tear off little pieces,” explained a chef.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 per cent fat beef drippings or rendered beef fat</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salted butter, diced</li>
        <li>4 thinly sliced leeks, white and pale-green parts only</li>
        <li>2 tsp dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt & Peppa <em>(to taste)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Now, let us get cookin!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the salted beef drippings in a large skillet over medium-high heat</li>

        <li>Add the butter and leeks</li>

        <li>Cook, stirring often, until the leeks begin to soften and lightly brown. Remove from the heat and let the leeks cool slightly</li>

        <li>Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add the mustard and the cayenne and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for about a minute</li>

        <li>Stir in the ham and the cabbage and cook, stirring frequently, until the cabbage begins to soften and the ham is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

        <li>Taste for seasoning. Spoon the mixture into a shallow baking dish. Place in a preheated 350F oven and bake for 1 hour or until the hams are fork-tender.</li>

    </ol>
    <p> <em>Note: To serve, remove the hams from the dish and let them cool. Remove any liquid from the ham and slice off and reserve the fat. Place the reserved fat back in the pan. Cook over medium heat for 4 minutes until the fat has rendered. Strain the fat from the pan and return the cooked ham and onions to the pan. Scatter the green onions.</em></p>
